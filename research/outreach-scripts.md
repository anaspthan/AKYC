# Outreach Scripts

## 1. Crypto Community (Telegram/Discord)

### Initial Message
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I built a Video KYC that's specifically optimized for crypto onboarding:
- Works on 2G networks (perfect for global users)
- ID + liveness + proof of address in <45 seconds
- $0.99 per verification (vs $3-5 from Jumio/Onfido)
- 15 languages including Arabic, Hindi, Tagalog

Anyone here struggling with KYC drop-offs or high costs? Happy to give 500 free verifications to test.
```

### Follow-up (3 days later)
```
Quick update: Already helping 2 exchanges reduce KYC drop-off from 40%+ to under 10%.

The secret? Works on terrible internet connections. Most KYC fails because users have slow networks.

DM me if you want a demo 📊
```

## 2. Remittance Companies (LinkedIn)

### Connection Request Message
```
Hi [Name], saw you're working on [Company] - love what you're building in the remittance space. I've been working on low-bandwidth KYC specifically for corridors like Philippines→UAE and Nigeria→UK. Would love to connect!
```

### Follow-up After Acceptance
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: What's your current KYC drop-off rate?

I'm seeing 30-50% drop-offs with traditional providers because they don't work well on 2G/3G networks in emerging markets.

Built a wrapper around enterprise KYC APIs that's optimized for low-bandwidth + supports local IDs. Costs $1.20 per verification vs $3-5 from big providers.

Would you be open to a 15-min demo? I can show you how we're getting drop-off rates under 10% for similar use cases.
```

## 3. Fintech Founders (Email)

### Subject: KYC that works on 2G - $0.99

```
Hi [Name],

[Specific compliment about their product]

Quick pitch: I built a Video KYC wrapper that costs $0.99 and works perfectly on 2G networks.

Why it matters:
- Your current KYC probably has 30-50% drop-off in emerging markets
- Big providers (Jumio, Onfido) charge $3-5 and aren't optimized for slow connections
- Mine uses the same underlying tech but adds extreme low-bandwidth mode + 15 languages

Would love to give you 500 free verifications to test. 

Can I send you a quick Loom demo?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## 4. Agency/Reseller Pitch

### Subject: White-label KYC for your clients

```
Hi [Name],

Do you have fintech/crypto clients who need KYC?

I've built a white-label Video KYC platform:
- You charge clients $2-3 per verification
- I charge you $0.99
- You keep the markup
- I handle all the tech

Current partners are making $1k-3k/month passive income reselling this.

Interested in exploring a partnership?
```

## 5. Direct to Crypto Exchanges (Twitter DM)

```
Hey [Exchange Name] team,

Noticed you serve users in [Country]. Are you struggling with KYC drop-offs?

Built a Video KYC that:
✅ Works on 2G (critical for emerging markets)
✅ Supports [local language]
✅ $0.99 vs $3-5 from big providers
✅ Same security/compliance as Jumio

Would love to give you 1,000 free verifications to test.

DM me if interested 🚀
```

## 6. Follow-up Sequence (If No Response)

### Day 3
```
Hi [Name], following up on my message about low-bandwidth KYC. 

Quick question: What's your current cost per KYC verification?

Most people I talk to are paying $3-5. We're at $0.99 with the same (often better) success rates.

Worth a conversation?
```

### Day 7
```
[Name], last ping on this!

Happy to do a free 2-week pilot:
- 1,000 free verifications
- I'll customize anything you need
- No obligation

If not interested, no worries - but figured it's worth trying 🙂
```

### Day 14 (Breakup Email)
```
Hi [Name],

I'll stop bugging you after this 😅

But real quick: I'm closing my beta program this Friday.

If you want in (1,000 free verifications + custom setup), let me know by EOW.

If not, totally understand and wish you the best!

Cheers,
[Your Name]
```

## 7. Referral Request (For Happy Customers)

```
Hey [Name],

Quick favor: Since you're seeing good results with our KYC (congrats on the 8% drop-off rate btw! 🎉), would you be open to introducing me to 2-3 others who might benefit?

I'm specifically looking for:
- Crypto exchanges with global users
- Remittance companies
- Fintech serving emerging markets

Happy to give them the same beta pricing you got.

Thanks!
```

## Key Principles

1. **Personalize the first line** - mention something specific about them
2. **Lead with their pain** - high drop-offs, high costs, compliance headaches
3. **Quantify your value** - specific numbers (8% drop-off, $0.99, 45 seconds)
4. **Low friction ask** - "Can I send a Loom?" not "Let's schedule a call"
5. **Follow up 3x minimum** - most deals happen on follow-up #2-3

## Daily Outreach Goals

- **Week 1-2:** 10 messages/day (validation phase)
- **Week 3-4:** 15 messages/day (beta customer acquisition)
- **Month 2+:** 20 messages/day (scale)

## Response Rate Benchmarks

- **Cold outreach:** 15-25% response rate
- **Warm intros:** 60-80% response rate
- **Discovery call → pilot:** 30-40% conversion
- **Pilot → paying customer:** 50-70% conversion

**Your goal:** 200 outreach messages → 30-50 responses → 10-15 calls → 3-5 paying customers
