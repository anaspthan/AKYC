This folder contains everything you need to validate demand and acquire your first 10 customers.

## Files

2. **discovery-questions.md** - Interview guide for customer discovery calls
3. **customer-tracker.csv** - Spreadsheet to track prospects and conversations
4. **target-lists.md** - Where to find your ideal customers

## Quick Start

### Week 1-2: Validation Phase (30 conversations minimum)

**Goal:** Understand if people will actually pay for this

**Daily Action:**
- 5 cold outreach messages (Telegram/WhatsApp/LinkedIn)
- 2-3 discovery calls
- Update customer tracker

**Success Metric:**
- At least 5 people say "I'd pay for this" with specifics
- 3+ ask for a demo

### Week 3-4: Beta Customer Acquisition

**Goal:** Get 3-5 people to prepay $500

**Offer:**
"Pay $500 upfront, get 1,000 verifications + I'll customize anything you need for your use case"

**Why prepayment:**
- Filters serious customers from tire-kickers
- Gives you runway to build
- Validates they trust you

### Metrics to Track

- **Outreach sent:** 200+ (target)
- **Response rate:** 15-25% (good)
- **Discovery calls:** 20-30
- **Warm leads:** 10-15
- **Paying customers:** 3-5

## Tips

1. **Be specific:** Don't say "KYC solution" - say "Video KYC that works on 2G for $0.99"
2. **Lead with pain:** "Are you losing customers because your KYC fails on slow networks?"
3. **Show, don't tell:** Record 30-second Loom videos
4. **Follow up 3x:** Most deals happen on follow-up #2 or #3
5. **Ask for intros:** "Who else should I talk to about this?"
