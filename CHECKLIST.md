## 🛑 Red Flags (Stop & Reassess)

If any of these happen, pause and reassess:

- [ ] Week 2: <5 discovery calls → Your outreach isn't working
- [ ] Week 4: <2 beta customers → Pricing/positioning is off
- [ ] Week 8: <$3k MRR → Not enough volume or conversion issues
- [ ] Week 12: <$8k MRR → Fundamental problem with product or market

**Fix before continuing:**
1. Talk to 10 more customers (discovery calls)
2. Test different messaging/channels
3. Consider pivoting niche (crypto → remittance, etc.)
